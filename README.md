# Yelp_Database_Application
Developed a data analysis application which allows users to search businesses according to their interest from Yelp website dataset. Users can also view different reviews and ratings of any specific business. Implemented JSON file parsing to scan huge Yelp website dataset and SQL queries store the data into the database.

Steps:
1. First run the createdb.sql file to create all the tables in the database.
2. After that run the populate.java file so that all the json files are parsed and data is inserted in the tables. For each json file, the file should be in the same folder as populate.java. (Not able to upload json files here as they excedeed the maximum file size limit)
3. Then run hw3.java file to display the GUI and work on it further.
4. Finally, when you run dropdb.sql file, all the tables are dropped in the database.
